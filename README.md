# ARFF-KLMS
This project simulates an experiment using Adaptive Random Fourier Features Kernel Least Mean Squares (ARFF-KLMS) to approximate non-linear functions. The algorithm adapts kernel bandwidth online, enhancing tracking and convergence in non-stationary environments. The experiment calculates and plots MSE over iterations for performance evaluation.
